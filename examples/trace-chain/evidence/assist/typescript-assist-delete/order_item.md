# TypeScript Assist — Delete `Order Item`

Load the current row and its original optimistic version. Never reconstruct an
entity from client-supplied ID/version. Delete is audited, version-aware soft
deletion; do not invent physical-delete APIs.

```typescript
import { Q } from './Q';
import { UserContext } from '../teaql-ts';

export async function deleteOrderItem(
    id: string,
    context: UserContext,
): Promise<boolean> {
    const entity = await Q.orderItems()
        .withIdIs(id)

        .comment('what: load current Order Item for deletion')
        .purpose('why: preserve original version for optimistic locking')
        .executeForOne(context);
    if (!entity) return false;

    await entity.markForDeletion()
        .auditAs('Delete Order Item for the requested business operation')
        .save(context);
    return true;
}
```

Compile the source unchanged. Prove retained negative-version persistence,
normal-query hiding, `deletedRowsOnly()` visibility, stale-copy rejection,
not-found false, audit enforcement, and physical-delete compilation failure.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact TYPESCRIPT generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `delete`.

- Load the policy-scoped current entity, mark it for deletion, then use audited
  save with the same UserContext. Do not invent a physical-delete API.
- Require an audit reason and optimistic version. Test missing audit and stale
  version as explicit failures.
