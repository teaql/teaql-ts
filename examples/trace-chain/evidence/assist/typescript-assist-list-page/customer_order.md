# TypeScript Assist — List page `Customer Order`

Use the exact generated entry point and APIs below. The result is a typed
page result whose `data` is a `SmartList` with exact filtered `totalCount`. The fixed 10,000-row
runtime ceiling cannot be overridden by generated client code.

```typescript
import { Q } from './Q';
import { CustomerOrder } from './models/CustomerOrder';
import { TeaQLPage, UserContext } from '../teaql-ts';

export async function listActiveCustomerOrderPage(
    context: UserContext,
    offset: number,
    limit: number,
): Promise<TeaQLPage<CustomerOrder>> {
    return Q.customerOrdersWithMinimalFields()
        .selectOrderNumber()
        .selectDescription()
        .selectPlatformWith(Q.platformsWithMinimalFields())
        .selectOrderItemListWith(Q.orderItemsWithMinimalFields())
        .selectPaymentListWith(Q.paymentsWithMinimalFields())
        .selectShipmentListWith(Q.shipmentsWithMinimalFields())
        .orderByIdAscending()
        .comment('what: list the active Customer Order page')
        .purpose('why: serve the authorized Customer Order directory')
        .executeForPage(context, offset, limit);
}
```

Compile and execute this source unchanged. Keep stable unique ID ordering.
Rows and total count must share the exact generated filters; count excludes
projection, relations, ordering, offset, and limit. Reject negative offsets,
limits outside `1...10000`, unknown filters/sorts, raw UI query JSON, missing
intent, and every generated-client attempt to call `hardLimit`.

For bounded streaming, use the same generated request and Context. Streaming
does not compute an exact total count and does not imply an authorization bypass:

```typescript
for await (const entity of Q.customerOrders()
    .orderByIdAscending()
    .limit(20)
    .comment('what: stream a bounded Customer Order selection')
    .purpose('why: process the authorized selection')
    .executeForStream(context, 10)) {
    // Use loaded E expressions here. Each returned root owns its mutation graph.
}
```

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact TYPESCRIPT generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `list-page`.

- Validate offset, page size, filters, deep paths, IN-list size, and sort against
  explicit allow-lists. Reject invalid input instead of widening the query.
- Use a stable unique ordering and retain the runtime hard limit. Continuous-page
  optimization is opt-in, browsing-only, local runtime policy and cannot cross TFP.
- Run count only when explicitly requested; otherwise use the returned list length.
