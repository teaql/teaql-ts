# TypeScript Assist — Create `Customer Order`

Use the exact generated `Q.customerOrders()` entry point. The
trusted `UserContext` supplies actor, tenant, policy, provider, and audit sink;
none of those values may be accepted from the writable input.

```typescript
import { UserContext } from '../teaql-ts';
import { Q } from './Q';
import { CustomerOrder } from './models/CustomerOrder';

export interface CreateCustomerOrderInput {
    platform: string | number;
    orderNumber: string;
    description: string;

}

export async function createCustomerOrder(
    input: CreateCustomerOrderInput,
    context: UserContext,
): Promise<CustomerOrder> {
    const entity = Q.customerOrders()
        .comment('what: initialize Customer Order')
        .purpose('why: create Customer Order')
        .newEntity(context);

    entity.updatePlatform(input.platform);
    entity.updateOrderNumber(input.orderNumber);
    entity.updateDescription(input.description);

    await entity
        .auditAs('Create Customer Order for the requested business operation')
        .save(context);
    return entity;
}
```

Only the generated updater methods above are writable. Constant relation
candidates, when present, are also generated and must be copied exactly:

Compile the result unchanged. Test persistence and query-back, and prove that
blank/missing intent, blank/missing audit reason, unknown fields, and attempted
trusted-context overrides fail. Do not edit generated sources.

## Compose one audited graph

Create each child using its own generated Q entry point and Create Assist, then
attach it with the exact model-derived collection API:

| Reverse relation | Child entry point | Attach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order_item_list` | `Q.orderItems()` | `entity.orderItemList().push(child)` |
| `payment_list` | `Q.payments()` | `entity.paymentList().push(child)` |
| `shipment_list` | `Q.shipments()` | `entity.shipmentList().push(child)` |


Use `child.auditAs('authorize payment')` to add a local reason. Leave it unset
to inherit the root reason; creation-query comment is separate. Keep an existing
child marked with `child.markForDeletion().auditAs('remove unavailable item')`
in the composed graph. Call only `entity.auditAs('submit order').save(context)`
on the root. Generated cascades preserve branch-local reasons and assigned IDs;
the runtime emits committed audit only after the complete graph commits.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact TYPESCRIPT generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `create`.

- Validate and allow-list writable business fields; never mass-assign dynamic JSON.
- Create through the generated request/entity API, attach a non-empty audit reason,
  save with the same UserContext, and return the runtime's native save result.
- Add a negative test proving a missing audit reason cannot write.
